# G1G2_PROJECT

## Description
The main objective of the project, as stated before, is the development of a model to predict the additional time an aircraft will spend in the airport due to the deicing period. There are, however, things surrounding such a model that also need to be created so it can be useful. Thus, itâ€™s expected that, at the end of the project, the following list of deliverables be adequately completed:

An AI model to predict the deicing time of a plane An API to access such a model A visual way to show the previously mentioned AI model working

A document on how to use all of these programs, what their inputs and outputs are, will also be needed.
